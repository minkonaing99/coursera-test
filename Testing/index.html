        There are ton of CSS properties that effect 
        the way text is displayed. I'm not going to attempt to cover 
        every single one of them. Instead, we'll take a look at a few that 
        illustrate the concepts behind their stylings. Let's jump straight 
        into the code editor and take a look.

          increase it by 120%. You can actually do a quick calculation and figure out 
          what pixel size that would be. Most browsers have 16 pixels as default text size. 
          So 120% of 16 would a little bit over 19 pixels. So if we refresh the page, w
          e'll see that we increased the font size in the entire HTML document. Let's now 
          target the very first text here that says 2em text. So lets go ahead and actually 
          use an inline style since we're just testing and specify the font size to be 2em.

        Okay let's talk a little bit about relative font sizing. And for that we're going
         to take a look at font size before that HTML. And it's located in the same folder
          as the previous file. Now there are two units of measurements that are relative 
          that we're going to talk about and that is percent and ems. Let's start with 
          percent first of all let's specify that our body tag should have fun size of 
          a 120 %. And what that means is Is that we want to take whatever the default 
          size is, and by default I mean whatever the browser provides by default, and

        And is a unit of measurement that is equivalent to the width of the letter m in this 
          particular font that we're using. It sounds a little bit confusing at first, but the bottom 
          line is it's a relative size. It's relative to something. And for this div where it says 2em t
          ext, what this is saying is it's relative to whatever the font size is at the moment we're applying it. 
          Since we set the font size to 120% in the entire body, this div also received at 120% and when you 
          combine this font size with this one, this basically says
